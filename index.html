			<h3>Today, I had the pleasure of interviewing the one and only Alicia Souliotis. We sat on the floor of her room in the Oak dorm of St. Marks School. I ended getting anwsers to a lot of questions I never asked, but I guess thats what I get for asking what her favorite Lunchables is. </h3>

			<h3>What is your favorite Food and why? </h3>

			<p> Well I think my favorite food in the entire world is a blueberry. They are just a very solid fruit that is very underapreciated in my opinion. However, I think personally that my spirt fruit is a strawberry.</p>

			<h3>What is your favorite music in the world?</h3>

			<p>My favorite song at the moment is Let You Down by NF becuase it is just a Bop. My favorite artist of like all time is Sam Hunt becuase his voice is like an angel, and my favorite album is Red by Taylor Swift because it has a lot of jams.</p>

			<h3>What is your favorite vacation place?</h3>

			<p>My favorite place to vacation is the Outerbanks of North Carolina. I remember one time I was there with my family and my cousins and I were throwing waterbaloons at peoples houses. We threw it at this one guys house and he came out. We were expecting him to yell at us, but instead he joined our water balloon fight and started throwing them at all of us. It was pretty fun.</p>

			<h3>What is the one thing in the world you would change?</h3>

			<p>Donald Trump. (Her words not mine please don't get angry at me).</p>

			<h3>If you could be a Disney Villian who would you be and why?</h3>

			<p>Maleficant because DRAGONS!!! I mean is that even a question. She is by far the most bad**s villian in all of the disney realm. No one even comes close to reaching her status.</p>

			<h3>Name some of your favorite things.</h3>

			<p>Well my favorite letter is Q. My favorite flying animal would be a bat. My favorite Nail Polish color is Dark Red. My favorite Disney Channel Orignal Movie is High School Musical, and my favorite Disney Channel Show is Wizards of Waverly Place. My favorite Kardashian is Kendall. My favorite Gatorade flavor is Yellow.</p>

			<h3>What is your favorite Lunchables flavor?</h3>

			<p>The pizza one except I am pretty sure it gave me Food Poisoninng.</p>

			<h3>Anything else that you would like to add?</h3>

			<p>Um. I think that if I was a power ranger, I would be the blue one, and you should definitly call this interview something cool like, Living the Lit Life of Alicia.</p>

			<h3>As you can see, I had a rather informative meeting with Ms. Souliotis that resulted in me knowing a lot of things I didn't need to or want to know. If you actually took the time to read all this then you are really cool. I think that if someone were to read this then they should defintily give me a good grade on this, because I think this website is pretty beautiful. *wink*.</h3>
